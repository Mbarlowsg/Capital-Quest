# GTS-final-game
Digital version of a game made for ULEC 2940.

This is mainly to prototype the cards for the game.


# Rule Book:

## Definitions:

### General Definitions:
#### Tax:
The money that players pay to the government at the beginning of each round.

#### Income:
The money that players (excluding government) receive at the beginning of each round.

#### Group specific resource:
Each group has a *group specific resource*: The working class has their labor, (INSERT OTHER GROUP RESOURCES HERE). These resources can be used to *veto* policies or can be sold to other groups for money.

#### Recipient:
The *recipient* is the group that another group must pay. Example: The corporation is a *recipient* of the government and the working class is a *recipient* of the corporation. A group's *recipient* list may change through the game depending on the active policy cards and chance cards.

### Actions:
#### Lobbying:
A player can *lobby* against a *policy card* that the *policy card holder* has picked. This can be done by in one of two ways:
1. Negotiating a monetary amount to be paid to the policy card holder by the players. If one player wants the policy gone then they must pay the full amount, if both players want the policy removed they each pay half of the negotiated price.
2. Using the *group specific resource* to veto the policy. This can be done by any player to immediately remove the policy card. This action will cost the player the amount of *group specific resource* listed on the card.

### Card Definitions:

#### Goal Card:
At the beginning of the game, each group draws three goal cards from their group specific decks. They then choose one goal card from this selection. Players **must** act in accordance with their goals throughout the entire game. Players should attempt to keep their goals secret from other players.

#### Policy Card:
Policy cards are drawn by a player at the beginning of their turn. This card is then shown to the other groups and players can choose to *veto* or *lobby* against the policy. If no players want to *veto* or *lobby* against the policy, it is instated. Instated policies last for the entire duration of the game.

#### Chance Card:
Chance cards are drawn by a player at the end of their turn. They symbolize random events that may occur during the game. Chance cards state whether they can be hidden or must be shown at the bottom of the card. If a card states that it is to be shown, the player **must** show the card to the others otherwise players may choose to show or hide the card.

#### Reputation Cards:
Reputation cards have an amount between 1-2 and others can voteÂ on up or down effect of reputation. Neutral if disagreed.
## Flow of Gameplay:

### 1. Start:
- The players are split into three groups: Government, Corporation and Working Class.
- All groups receive $100,000.
- Each group draws three *Goal cards* from their corresponding deck of *Goal cards* and chooses one from the selection.

### 2. Player turns:
- The government begins the game by drawing the first policy card (*2a*) followed by drawing a chance card after the policy passes/fails (*2b*).
- Once the government finishes their turn, the corporation then plays their turn followed by the working class.
- When all three groups have had a turn, the next round begins (*3*).

#### 2a. Player draws policy card
- The player draws their *Policy card* and shows it to the other players.
- They decides whether they want to *veto* the policy (uses *group specific resource*).
- The other two groups decide whether they want to *veto* or *lobby* against the policy.
- If the policy is not *vetoed* or *lobbied* against, the policy is instated. Else the policy fails and the game moves to the next step.

#### 2b. Player draws chance card:
- The player draws their chance card.
- If a card states that it is to be shown, the player **must** show the card to the others otherwise players may choose to show or hide the card.
- Once the player has finished acting on the chance card, or chooses to hide it, the next player's turn begins at point *2a*. 

### 3. Next Round Begins:
- The government pays their *recipient* groups the listed *income* amount.
- The corporation pays the working class their listed *income* amount.
- The working class and corporation pay their *taxes* to the government.
- If a group does not have enough money to pay the *income* or *taxes*, they can sell their *group specific resource* to other groups in exchange for money. If a group has no more money and no *group specific resources* to sell, they lose the game. 
- When all groups finish paying each other, the government draws the policy card and the game continues from *step 2*.
- After 10 rounds have been played, the game ends.

### Ending:
- If the game reaches the 10 round limit, the players show each other their *goal cards*. They then overview the instated policy cards and vote on which team was closest to their goal. Players may not vote for their own teams and if there are multiple players per team, their votes will be counted individually.
