Welcome to Capital Quest! A game where your main objective is to manage your money in line with your group goal, using income and taxes. 

In this game you will be split into three groups: *Government*, *Corporations* & *Working Class*. Groups may have as many people as you want in them, but please keep the group size as equal as is practical. At the beginning of the game each team will receive 100.000 *Money*. This money is circulated between the teams through *income* and *tax* (diagram below). *Income* and *tax* are paid at the beginning of each round and *income* is always paid before *tax*.

## Tax/Income Diagram:

The game begins with each group will drawing three *Goal Cards* from their respective decks and selecting one of the three goals. Each group's selected *Goal Card* is the goal that the group should work towards during the game. These goals should be kept secret from the other groups. The game ends when 10 rounds have been played or a group runs out of money. At that point the group that is closest to achieving their goal is the winner.

The first round begins with the *Government* drawing a *Policy Card*. This *Policy Card* can be *lobbied* against by other teams or they can *veto* the policy and discard the *money* listed on the *Policy Card*. After the *Policy Card* is either instated or vetoed, the Government draws a *Chance Card*. This is considered one **turn**. After the Government has a turn, the *Corporations* will go followed by the *Working Class*. This constitutes one **round**. 

Below is a list of the terms used frequently throughout the game, followed by the in-depth flow of gameplay. Please refer to these resources as needed during your playthrough of the game. Have fun!

## Definitions:

### General Definitions:
#### Tax:
The money that players pay to the government at the beginning of each round.

#### Income:
The money that players (excluding government) receive at the beginning of each round.

#### Recipient:
The *recipient* is the group that another group must pay. Example: The corporation is a *recipient* of the government and the working class is a *recipient* of the corporation. A group's *recipient* list may change through the game depending on the active policy cards and chance cards.

### Actions:
#### Lobbying:
A player can *lobby* against a *policy card* that the policy card holder has picked. This can be done by paying the amount listed on the card to the policy card holder by the players. If one player wants the policy gone then they must pay the full amount, if both players want the policy removed they each pay half of the negotiated price.

#### Veto:
A *policy card* holder can *veto* their own policy by disposing of the amount of money listed on the policy card. This money is removed from the game and is no longer able to be used. 


### Card Definitions:

#### Goal Card:
At the beginning of the game, each group draws three goal cards from their group specific decks. They then choose one goal card from this selection. Players **must** act in accordance with their goals throughout the entire game. Players should attempt to keep their goals secret from other players.

#### Policy Card:
Policy cards are drawn by a player at the beginning of their turn. This card is then shown to the other groups and players can choose to *veto* or *lobby* against the policy. If no players want to *veto* or *lobby* against the policy, it is instated. Instated policies last for the entire duration of the game.

#### Chance Card:
Chance cards are drawn by a player at the end of their turn. They symbolize random events that may occur during the game. Chance cards state whether they can be hidden or must be shown at the bottom of the card. If a card states that it is to be shown, the player **must** show the card to the others otherwise players may choose to show or hide the card.

## Flow of Gameplay:

### 1. Start:
- The players are split into three groups: Government, Corporation and Working Class.
- All groups receive $100,000.
- Each group draws three *Goal cards* from their corresponding deck of *Goal cards* and chooses one from the selection.

### 2. Player turns:
- The government begins the game by drawing the first policy card (*2a*) followed by drawing a chance card after the policy passes/fails (*2b*).
- Once the government finishes their turn, the corporation then plays their turn followed by the working class.
- When all three groups have had a turn, the next round begins (*3*).

#### 2a. Player draws policy card
- The group draws their *Policy card* and shows it to the other groups.
- They decide whether they want to *veto* the policy.
- The other two groups decide whether they want to *lobby* against the policy.
- If the policy is not *vetoed* or *lobbied* against, the policy is instated. Else the policy fails and the game moves to the next step.

#### 2b. Player draws chance card:
- The group draws their chance card.
- If a card states that it is to be shown, the group **must** show the card to the others otherwise groups may choose to show or hide the card.
- Once the group has finished acting on the chance card, or chooses to hide it, the next group's turn begins at point *2a*. 

### 3. Next Round Begins:
- The government pays their *recipient* groups the listed *income* amount.
- The corporation pays the working class their listed *income* amount.
- The working class and corporation pay their *taxes* to the government.
- If a group does not have enough money to pay the *income* or *taxes*, they lose.
- When all groups finish paying each other, the government draws the policy card and the game continues from *step 2*.
- After 10 rounds have been played, the game ends.

### Ending:
- If the game reaches the 10 round limit, the players show each other their *goal cards*. They then overview the instated policy cards and vote on which team was closest to their goal. Players may not vote for their own teams and if there are multiple players per team, their votes will be counted individually.
